 All rights reserved.

eTeks, editor of SweetHome3D and SweetHome3DJS, has granted CINCHEO the right to sell SaaS licences of 
SweetHome3D and SweetHome3J as the SweetHome3D Online (SH3DO) product.

As a RETAILER (webmaster), having access to a RETAILER API Key for your domain name will allow you to embed 
SweetHome3D Online in your web site, as long as you conform to the terms and conditions of the LICENSE, which 
are summarized hereafter.

An SH3DO LICENSE is a contract between CINCHEO and a RETAILER, i.e. an indivual or a company wanting to embed 
SH3DO within a web site attached to a given DOMAIN.

The RETAILER agrees to the following terms and conditions.

- The RETAILER agrees to a given plan knowing the limitations (available features and quotas).

- No sub-licensing of the SH3DO license is allowed. Generally speaking, CINCHEO and eTeks will make sure that 
  the RETAILER does not intend to compete with CINCHEO and eTeks businesses before granting or renewing a LICENSE.

- White branding is allowed, but mention and link to be available on the RETAILER web site (should be visible 
  next the SH3DO components for the free STARTER plan).

- The use of SH3DO remains for web sites only. No apps embedding SH3DO directly or indirectly through a website can 
  be sold on an app store of any kind. Please contact us to discuss such business models.

- Utilization fees must be paid upfront every year or every month.
